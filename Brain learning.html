        <orbit-prompt
            question="Describe the cerebellum and its function."
            answer="The cerebellum, often called the 'little brain,' is located at the back of the brain below the cerebrum. It contains over half of the brain's neurons and plays a crucial role in coordinating voluntary movements, maintaining balance, and posture."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the function of Broca's area, located in the frontal lobe?"
            answer="Broca's area is crucial for speech production."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the function of Wernicke's area, located in the temporal lobe?"
            answer="Wernicke's area is crucial for language comprehension."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the hippocampus responsible for?"
            answer="The hippocampus, located in the temporal lobe, plays a vital role in memory formation and consolidation."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="Describe the amygdala and its function."
            answer="The amygdala, located deep within the temporal lobe, is an almond-shaped structure primarily involved in processing emotions, particularly fear and anxiety."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the hypothalamus responsible for?"
            answer="The hypothalamus, located below the thalamus, regulates vital bodily functions such as body temperature, hunger, thirst, and sleep."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the function of the thalamus?"
            answer="The thalamus acts as a relay center for sensory information, transmitting signals to the appropriate areas of the cerebral cortex."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the corpus callosum?"
            answer="The corpus callosum is a thick band of nerve fibers that connects the two hemispheres of the brain, enabling communication between them."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the difference between gray matter and white matter?"
            answer="Gray matter primarily consists of neuron cell bodies, while white matter consists primarily of myelinated axons, which transmit signals between different parts of the brain."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the function of the basal ganglia?"
            answer="The basal ganglia play a crucial role in motor control, learning, and habit formation."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the function of the brainstem?"
            answer="The brainstem controls vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the difference between the central and peripheral nervous systems?"
            answer="The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system consists of all the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the function of the spinal cord?"
            answer="The spinal cord transmits signals between the brain and the rest of the body, and also controls reflexes."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="What is the difference between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems?"
            answer="The sympathetic nervous system prepares the body for action (fight-or-flight response), while the parasympathetic nervous system helps the body relax and conserve energy."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="How might damage to the frontal lobe affect a person's ability to make decisions?"
            answer="Damage to the frontal lobe, which is responsible for executive functions like decision-making, planning, and problem-solving, can lead to difficulties in making sound judgments, impulsivity, and impaired decision-making abilities."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="Compare and contrast the functions of the hippocampus and the amygdala."
            answer="The hippocampus is primarily involved in memory formation and consolidation, while the amygdala plays a crucial role in processing emotions, particularly fear and anxiety."
        ></orbit-prompt>

        <orbit-prompt
            question="How might damage to the cerebellum affect a person's daily life?"
            answer="Damage to the cerebellum can lead to difficulties with coordination, balance, and movement, affecting activities such as walking, speaking, and fine motor skills."
